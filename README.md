## Chapter 2

I was able to implement a Hello World! application both with an intro to server implementation and server-less. While following along in the book, we used several different node, express, react applications to modify our raw input javascript for different browser compatibility, and implementations for dividing up our code across files and directories. We also used in-built applications to refactor our code to split theses files up, and tell the computer and server where to look to find these instructions. Overall, I had a hard time completely understanding what I was doing while following these instructions at an in-depth level, but did get a general idea on most topics.
