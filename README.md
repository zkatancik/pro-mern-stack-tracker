## Chapter 3

In this chapter we began the issue tracker project as mentioned to be the main project in the book. We used tables and classes, as well as built the project using a .jsx file and node to build our .js file. We also learned how to set up classes in React, and how to pass information between classes within our .jsx file. Still getting used to the syntax of everything React, it seems that passing information as parameters to other files and functions is different than I 've seen in the past, as well, getting used to the act of mixing in the html and css elements into the JS stuff and how that all works.

## Chapter 2

I was able to implement a Hello World! application both with an intro to server implementation and server-less. While following along in the book, we used several different node, express, react applications to modify our raw input javascript for different browser compatibility, and implementations for dividing up our code across files and directories. We also used in-built applications to refactor our code to split theses files up, and tell the computer and server where to look to find these instructions. Overall, I had a hard time completely understanding what I was doing while following these instructions at an in-depth level, but did get a general idea on most topics.
